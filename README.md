### A bit about me

Hey there — I'm glitchbytez, a computer science student with a strong interest in cybersecurity and software development. I'm passionate about understanding how systems work, how they break, and how to build them back up with better security and cleaner code.

I spend my time digging into networks, writing scripts, building tools, and exploring automation. I enjoy working on side projects that challenge how I think, and I’m always learning something new.

### What I'm exploring

Right now, I’m deepening my skills in cybersecurity and programming — particularly in Python, Java, and JavaScript. I’m also looking into automation and scripting to make repetitive tasks less painful (and more fun).

Most of my personal projects are private at the moment while I refine them. Once they’re in a good place, I’ll be sharing them here.

### The setup

OS: Linux-based  
Editor: VS Code (but tempted by Vim every other week)  
Current learning rabbit hole: custom tooling + network security

### The vibe

break stuff. learn. build better. repeat.
